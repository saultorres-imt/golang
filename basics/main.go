/*
The 'fmt' package in Go is one of the most essential and frequently used libraries in the Go programming language.
It provides a wide range of functionalities for formatting and printing of output, as well as taking input.
Key functions include:
  - fmt.Print(), fmt.Println(), fmt.Printf(): Used for printing output to the console. Print() outputs text as is,
    Println() adds a newline at the end, and Printf() allows for formatted output using verbs like %v, %d, %s, etc.
  - fmt.Scanf(), fmt.Scanln(), fmt.Scan(): These functions are used for taking input from the user. Scanf() reads
    formatted input, Scanln() reads input until a newline is encountered, and Scan() reads input separated by spaces.
  - fmt.Sprintf(): Similar to Printf(), but instead of printing to the console, it returns the formatted string.
  - fmt.Errorf(): Used for creating error messages with formatted text, handy for error handling with descriptive messages.
